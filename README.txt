This is a compiler that translates Simple-Java programs into MIPS assembly.
You must build the compiler by running buid.py!



build.py - Builds the compiler.

demo.py - A script for easily compiling and running included example sjava programs.

sjavac.py - A wrapper python script for calling the compiler.
	Usage: ./sjavac.py <path to sjava file>



This project uses 2 external jar files located in tools/
	javacc.jar - for generating the parser
	Mars_4_5.jar - for running MIPS assembly


Don't have too much fun!
