This is a compiler that translates Simple-Java programs into MIPS assembly.


To build the simple java compiler run the script build.py

To compile a sjava file into MIPS run sjavac.py with the sjava file as a parameter

To test a sample program run test.py. You will need change the MARSPATH variable in the script so it specifies the correct path to the MARS jar file.

Don't have too much fun!
